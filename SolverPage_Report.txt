SolverPage Test Suite - Updated Comprehensive Report

Summary:
The JSX parsing error in Jest tests has been resolved by fixing an undefined export in the test-utils.jsx file. The SolverPage test suite is now fully functional and correctly transpiled, allowing smooth Jest test runs without syntax errors.

Test Coverage:
- Authentication states:
  - Tests verify UI behavior when the user is authenticated and unauthenticated.
- Error handling:
  - Tests cover failure scenarios for fetching history and solving problems.
- Image upload:
  - Tests simulate image upload, processing, and solving math problems from images.
- Recording functionality:
  - Tests simulate voice recording, transcription, and solving problems from voice input.
- UI elements:
  - Tests check for presence of key UI components like input fields, buttons, and solution display.

Configuration:
- Jest is configured with babel-jest to transform JS and JSX files.
- Babel config includes react-app preset.
- setupTests.js imports React globally for tests and mocks browser APIs.
- test-utils.jsx provides custom render with context providers and theming for consistent test environment.

Outstanding:
- No known issues remain related to JSX parsing or test execution.
- Additional tests for other components or integration flows can be added as needed.

Note:
Due to size constraints, detailed source code and test files related to SolverPage are provided separately for review and analysis.
